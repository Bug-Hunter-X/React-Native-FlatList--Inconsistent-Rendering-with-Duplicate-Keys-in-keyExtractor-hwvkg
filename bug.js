This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing a keyExtractor function that doesn't return a unique key for each item.  This often happens when the data source changes frequently or the keyExtractor logic is flawed.

```javascript
// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 1 }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs!
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
/>
```

The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items.  Using duplicate keys leads to unpredictable behavior, including incorrect rendering, dropped items, or performance issues.
